# Fun-with-Recursions
Denote by 𝑑(𝑛) the number of divisors of the positive integer 𝑛. For example, 𝑑(7)=2, because 1 and 7 are the only divisors of 7. Another example is 𝑑(30)=8, since the divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. Write a program that for given positive integer 𝑛 calculates ∑𝑑(𝑖).
